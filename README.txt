Load instructions:
1. Run the game in Visual Studio 2022.
2. Build and run the game.
3. Look at the pretty sprites and scaling and rotating meshes.
----------------------------------------

How to play:
1. Use WSAD to move the sprite of the man.
2. Marvel at the animation changes.
3. Use J to  turn on Debugging mode.
4. Stare in awe at the amazing lines and boxes and physics.
5. For even more awesome physics, press U to pause or unpause the game.
6. When the game is paused, press I to step to the next frame.
7. WOW!
8. Now if you've judged everything prepare to be even more amazed.
9. Press P to spawn 2500 game objects on the screen.
10. Now marvel at the amount of objects and high FPS.

NOTE: After you press P you cannot remove the 2500
objects. So if you want to view the scene without the 2500 objects,
you need to rebuild the application. :( Sorry.
